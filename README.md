Mortality Analysis and Predictive Modeling for Public Health - MINSAL Chile 

Project Overview
-In collaboration with the Ministry of Health of Chile (MINSAL), our team of data analysts and predictive modelers has been tasked with a mission: to conduct an in-depth analysis of mortality trends and patterns in Chile. This project is a strategic effort to enhance public health, optimize policy-making, and address key health challenges, with a particular focus on reducing health inequalities, increasing life expectancy, and improving the overall quality of life in Chile.



Objective

-The primary objective of this project is to develop reliable predictive models that will enable MINSAL to anticipate and respond effectively to emerging public health needs. Our predictive models aim to:
-Identify high-risk groups based on demographic and socioeconomic factors.
-Highlight leading causes of mortality and other key health determinants.
-Assist MINSAL in allocating resources and implementing targeted preventive and corrective health strategies to lower mortality rates.


Data and Approach
Our analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset that includes records on:

-Mortality and cause of death data.
-Disease diagnoses.
-Access to healthcare services.
-Other relevant health indicators.
-We will analyze relationships between demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic factors to offer a holistic perspective on the country's health challenges.


Predictive Model Focus

-The predictive model will be designed to estimate the likely cause of death based on demographic characteristics and other relevant factors. This tool will be invaluable for MINSAL in planning and prioritizing health policies, especially in vulnerable regions with limited access to healthcare.

Benefits

With these models, MINSAL will have actionable insights that will:

-Aid in policy-making and resource allocation.

-Provide focused support to high-risk populations.

-Facilitate the implementation of effective, data-driven health strategies.
